#Semantic HTML Demo

This is a copy of [Airbnb's site](http://airbnb.com) showing only barebone and the top overview of the semantic HTML.

I tried to replicate [Airbnb's site](http://airbnb.com) outline from [HTML5 Outliner](http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/). I did not place all the information and links from Airbnb onto this replicated page, rather only a few that stood out. Those included are navs, large texts in main content, and large footer texts.

####Issues

- The second line keeps showing "Untitled Section" in the HTML5 Outliner's output.
